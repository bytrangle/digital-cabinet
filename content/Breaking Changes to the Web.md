Last week, Chris wrote about Chrome’s decision to deprecate JavaScript dialogs including `alert()`, `prompt()`, and `confirm()` and then collected [a ton of opinions from developers](https://css-tricks.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=155f5a9ccc4e24c318130cace&id=ab0cece3f5&e=2df64611c3):

> Believe it or not, I generally am a fan of Google and think they do a good job of pushing the web forward. I also think it’s appropriate to waggle fingers when I see problems and request they do better. “Better” here means way more developer and user outreach to spell out the situation, way more conversation about the potential implications and transition ideas, and way more openness to bending the course ahead.

Through this post, I bumped into Jeremy Keith’s excellent note on the matter called [“Foundations”](https://css-tricks.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=155f5a9ccc4e24c318130cace&id=7821f925e3&e=2df64611c3) where he describes his concern for browsers that make breaking changes to the web:

> \[…] breaking changes don’t happen often on the web. They are—and should be—rare. If that were to change, the web would suffer massively in terms of predictability.
>
> Secondly, the onus is not on web developers to keep track of older features in danger of being deprecated. That’s on the browser makers. I sincerely hope we’re not expected to consult a site called [canistilluse.com](http://canistilluse.com/).

On that note, Rich Harris riffed on that point in [this great piece](https://css-tricks.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=155f5a9ccc4e24c318130cace&id=c3cb1ee1b5&e=2df64611c3):

> We can’t normalise the attitude that collateral damage is the price of progress, even if we accept the premise — which I don’t — that removing APIs like alert represents progress. For all its flaws, the web is generally agreed to be a stable platform, where investments made today will stand the test of time. A world in which websites are treated as inherently transient objects, where APIs we commonly rely on today could be cast aside as unwanted baggage by tomorrow’s spec wranglers, is a world in which the web has already lost.
