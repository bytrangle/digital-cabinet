Indie Hackers sat down with Joel to chat about bootstrapping the business, and how finding a niche-within-a-niche helped him succeed. Read on for more!

### Powder days

Most meteorologists know that they want to be a meteorologist very early in life due to some type of specific weather event, and I am no different. At four years old, I became interested in meteorology when I first went skiing in Pennsylvania.

Fast forward to grad school at the University of Colorado, where I realized that powder was my calling. A powder day is what you have right after a new snowfall. The snow is fresh, light, and powdery, all conditions that are perfect for skiing. I loved trying to forecast and pinpoint powder days. At the time, there weren't really many people laser-focused on powder days, so it took me some time to test my predictions.

I was wrong often, but eventually honed my skills and decided to try to make a business out of it. The analog business that had been around for a couple of decades was a company called [Surfline](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/d0u0r0xqw5s0hpmm9nhm/x0hph6hnelrvr6b5/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3VyZmxpbmUuY29tLw==). They do what we do for skiing, but they forecast waves for surfers. They'd been around well before the internet, so I figured that if they could produce a pretty good website and app, make money on advertising and subscriptions, and build a business for surfers, I could do something similar for skiers. I launched in 2011.

### Building the MVP

I am not a good developer, but I knew enough to start a WordPress blog. It cost around $50 for hosting per year. I did that while I still had a job writing forecasts, so my blog was just getting out to people organically.

It was only after doing that for a couple of years that people started to email me asking how to place ads in the blog. I decided to quit my job, having saved some money from working (and I didn't have a family at the time). Financially, it was the best time for me to go out and start the business.

I brought on a cofounder who helped to build the first iteration of the site.

### Growing OpenSnow

In the early years of the business, I consulted for ski publications that wanted me to write articles about different weather forecasts. This was a way to earn revenue while bootstrapping.

In 2013, I decided that I wanted more control over the business. We started a subscription product that was the next iteration of the financial side of the company. Within this past year, actually, the subscription product has brought in the majority of our revenue.

Our two revenue streams are subscriptions and advertising. The advertising supports the free version of the product, while the subscription provides access to a premium experience. If you focus too much on generating subscriptions, you lose the readership and page views on the ads. If you go really ad-heavy, you can make a few more bucks, but the revenue per user is much greater for subscription than it is for advertising. So there are tradeoffs.

We are now focused on growing our subscriber base, but advertising still plays a role.

### Annual users

As a private company, we don't give out everything, but we've got about 3M people that come to the site or app annually. We have close to 500K registered users, with a small percentage paying us. Our users came mostly from word-of-mouth.

Admittedly, we could do a better job of communicating the benefits of paying for a subscription. The world was vastly different when we started this in 2011; paying for things was not the norm. Now, people are far more used to paying for something that they find valuable. As a business, we had this worldview that was rooted in ideas from 10 years ago, but the world is just different. We need to evolve to match that.

### Advice for indie hackers

You need a good idea and strategy. But then, at some point, it becomes about finding great people and figuring out how to work together. Also, as a bootstrapper, you don't have a lot of leeway to recover from mistakes.

As a founder, your business is a massive part of your life. I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out what I want out of this business. We've had acquisition offers, but Iâ€™ve always declined because we have a lot of fun trying to achieve our vision. There are plenty of nights I'm up until two in the morning working. I'm super excited to do it, but that's my choice. We like being in control of what we're doing.
