One major determining factor in a product's success is how well it is launched. Read on for the ultimate checklist to help you prepare for launch day!

### Breaking it all down

_Prelaunch:_

-   Market research and competitive analysis: Before you do anything, take time to understand the environment that you'll be launching in. Do some [market research](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/zlu68623v0fnhqe8klcp/reh8hohq03wonkf2/aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmh1YnNwb3QuY29tL21hcmtldGluZy9tYXJrZXQtcmVzZWFyY2gtYnV5ZXJzLWpvdXJuZXktZ3VpZGU=) to understand your consumers. Conduct a [competitive analysis](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/zlu68623v0fnhqe8klcp/e0hph7hk0lqd5ri8/aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmh1YnNwb3QuY29tL21hcmtldGluZy9jb21wZXRpdGl2ZS1hbmFseXNpcy1raXQ=) to understand your competitors.
-   Determine your value proposition: Get really clear on your [value proposition and your unique selling proposition](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/zlu68623v0fnhqe8klcp/p8heh9h9z2gprksq/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuem9oby5jb20vYWNhZGVteS9tYXJrZXRpbmcvYnJhbmQtcG9zaXRpb25pbmcvY29taW5nLXVwLXdpdGgteW91ci1jb21wYW55cy11c3AtYW5kLXZhbHVlLXByb3Bvc2l0aW9uLmh0bWw=), as these will inform your product and your marketing.
-   Validate the idea: It's best to validate before you even start building. Check out this helpful [article on validation](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/zlu68623v0fnhqe8klcp/e0hph7hk0lqdmeh8/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kaWVoYWNrZXJzLmNvbS9wb3N0L3ZhbGlkYXRlLXlvdXItcHJvZHVjdC0xOS1tYXJrZXQtdGVzdGluZy1hbmQtbWFya2V0LXZhbGlkYXRpb24tdGFjdGljcy1wbHVzLTctdG9vbHMtZm9yLXZhbGlkYXRpbmctZGY4MmRkZjI1OT91dG1fc291cmNlPWluZGllLWhhY2tlcnMtZW1haWxzJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1paC1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWw=).
-   Determine business model and pricing: What is the best way to sell your product? Is it a subscription? One-time sale? Bundling?
-   Create a landing page with email capture: People need a place to land. Since they can't give you money yet, it's important to make it easy for them to give you their email addresses. You can create simple one-pagers with tools like [Carrd](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/zlu68623v0fnhqe8klcp/p8heh9h9z2gpr9tq/aHR0cHM6Ly9jYXJyZC5jby8=) and [Umso](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/zlu68623v0fnhqe8klcp/g3hnh5he3l60grcr/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudW1zby5jb20v).
-   Build an audience: The bigger your audience, the better the launch. Build in public, post consistently, collaborate, do guest posts, start a newsletter; just do what you can to get people interested in what you're doing. There are lots of free tips and guides out there on how to do this. Here are some [solid tips for growing your Twitter following](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/zlu68623v0fnhqe8klcp/08hwh9hmd9gpnpcl/aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmhvb3RzdWl0ZS5jb20vaG93LXRvLWdldC10d2l0dGVyLWZvbGxvd2Vycy8=).
-   Pick a launch date: Make sure it's feasible, but not overly comfortable. Spread the word and stick to the date!
-   Create a waitlist or run presales: You'll get emails, and maybe even some payments before you launch. Plus, this is one of the best ways to validate your product. Show your appreciation and sweeten the deal with exclusive offers.
-   Create an outreach list: Think influencers, journalists, potential customers, fellow entrepreneurs, and anyone else who will support you or benefit from your product. Warm them up if they're cold, and get the ball rolling on potential partnerships.
-   Finish the rest of your website: A one-pager is technically fine for a launch, but most products will benefit from a pricing page, contact page, about page, etc. Here's a handy [web launch checklist](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/zlu68623v0fnhqe8klcp/e0hph7hk0lqd6es8/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb2RlcGVuLmlvL294bGEvcGVuL2F3bU1ZWQ==).
-   Add privacy-friendly analytics: This is not strictly necessary, but it's very helpful. Consider tools like [Plausible](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/zlu68623v0fnhqe8klcp/p8heh9h9z2gpm9uq/aHR0cHM6Ly9wbGF1c2libGUuaW8v) or [Friendly](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/zlu68623v0fnhqe8klcp/58hvh7h5mnk4q7b6/aHR0cHM6Ly9mcmllbmRseS5pcy8=).
-   Set up support and feedback features: Make it painfully easy for your users to talk to you, ask questions, and provide feedback. Chat is a good option. Check out tools like [tawk.to](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/zlu68623v0fnhqe8klcp/n2hohvhn3x6lmph6/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGF3ay50by8=) and [Intercom](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/zlu68623v0fnhqe8klcp/wnh2hghrwkxlnet7/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW50ZXJjb20uY29tLw==).
-   Conduct a beta for feedback (and early adopters): Remove bugs and learn what your target market wants by doing a beta. If you've got waitlisters, they'll be happy to join. There are also platforms designed specifically for this, like [Betafy](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/zlu68623v0fnhqe8klcp/8ghqhohgl2q7z8hk/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmV0YWZ5LmNvLw==) and [BetaList](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/zlu68623v0fnhqe8klcp/l2hehmho3n6d25f6/aHR0cHM6Ly9iZXRhbGlzdC5jb20v). You could also check out [r/AlphaandBetaUsers](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/zlu68623v0fnhqe8klcp/m2h7h5ho8qml5gtm/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS9yL2FscGhhYW5kYmV0YXVzZXJzLw==) or ask for feedback here on IH.
-   Collect social proof: Get testimonials and other forms of social proof from friends, beta testers, and early adopters. Emphasize them on your website, pricing page, and marketing materials.
-   Stress test your product and site: Your launch will (hopefully) create a spike in traffic. Make sure your site can handle it. Tools like [Loader](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/zlu68623v0fnhqe8klcp/dpheh0hq0o826oim/aHR0cHM6Ly9sb2FkZXIuaW8v) and [LoadRunner](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/zlu68623v0fnhqe8klcp/7qh7h8h0o6wxlpuz/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWljcm9mb2N1cy5jb20vZW4tdXMvcHJvZHVjdHMvbG9hZHJ1bm5lci1wcm9mZXNzaW9uYWwvb3ZlcnZpZXc=) might be helpful.
-   Prepare outreach, posts, and promotion for launch day: You'll be reaching out to folks and posting on launch day too, but you'll probably be very busy, so prepare as much as possible ahead of time.

_Launch_

-   Launch: Here's a [list of a TON of places to launch](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/zlu68623v0fnhqe8klcp/z2hghnho3kpm6dhp/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kaWVoYWNrZXJzLmNvbS9wb3N0L3JlbGF1bmNoLWxpa2UtYS1wcm8tMTAwLXBsYWNlcy10by1sYXVuY2gtcmVsYXVuY2gtYW5kLWxpc3QteW91ci1wcm9kdWN0LTdjNjc4NzU2MzU_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1pbmRpZS1oYWNrZXJzLWVtYWlscyZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249aWgtbmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWls). Some of these platforms (like Product Hunt) have specific best practices of their own, so make sure to familiarize yourself first.
-   Reach out to your email list and outreach list: On launch day, take your prepared outreach and send it.
-   Market: Now that it's out there in the wild, you've got to let the world know.

_Post launch_

-   Follow up on outreach that had no response: Give it a few days, then follow up with anyone who didn't join in.
-   Analysis: How did it go? Did you hit your goals? What will you do better next time? Analyze the launch, then set new goals.
-   Relaunch: One launch isn't generally enough these days. Consider [relaunching](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/zlu68623v0fnhqe8klcp/z2hghnho3kpm6dhp/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kaWVoYWNrZXJzLmNvbS9wb3N0L3JlbGF1bmNoLWxpa2UtYS1wcm8tMTAwLXBsYWNlcy10by1sYXVuY2gtcmVsYXVuY2gtYW5kLWxpc3QteW91ci1wcm9kdWN0LTdjNjc4NzU2MzU_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1pbmRpZS1oYWNrZXJzLWVtYWlscyZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249aWgtbmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWls) across multiple platforms and sites.
