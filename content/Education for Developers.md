Hey IH! I'm [Chris Oliver](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/e5u9g9wzn2u7h8kw6oa8/kkhmh6h8876wmxsl/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9leGNpZDM=), a developer turned founder, and I run [GoRails](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/e5u9g9wzn2u7h8kw6oa8/58hvh7h55ekx74c6/aHR0cHM6Ly9nb3JhaWxzLmNvbQ==), an education business for Ruby on Rails developers.

I also run several other products: [Hatchbox](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/e5u9g9wzn2u7h8kw6oa8/25h2hoh77549dxh3/aHR0cHM6Ly9oYXRjaGJveC5pbw==) helps you deploy Ruby on Rails apps to your own servers and [Jumpstart Pro](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/e5u9g9wzn2u7h8kw6oa8/qvh8h7h88xownxhl/aHR0cHM6Ly9qdW1wc3RhcnRyYWlscy5jb20=) helps you build SaaS products in Rails.

AMA!

### How did you grow your mailing list?

For me, it was good content and always having email subscribe forms in the footer or sidebar. The quality of your subscribers matters, too. Some people have a 100K mailing list, but 4% open rates. I'd rather have a much smaller list with 50%+ open rates.

### How did you market your product when you first started?

I shared my videos on Reddit and other places where Rails developers were hanging out. Some people started sharing my tutorials on places like StackOverflow, which really helped to bring in the organic traffic.

Some people believe that Rails has lost its relevancy because people are just drawn to the newest cool thing. But Rails is still focused on making very small teams super productive, and I think there will always be a market for that.

### What challenges do you face in selling specifically to developers?

There's not a lot of education past beginner content. You have tons of introductory things, so trying to do intermediate and advanced topics helped me stand out. Developers are often cheap, especially with education, so I had to start with $19 per month and just let it grow slowly over time.

### Why wouldn't your audience just build their own solutions?

I'm helping them think through problems and how to approach them. They learn how to think about it from _me,_ which builds trust. If I launch a product, they'll know that it was built with the same thoughtful approach that they trust.

### How did you get your first users?

I just dug up my [original post](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/e5u9g9wzn2u7h8kw6oa8/g3hnh5heev69x7br/aHR0cHM6Ly9leGNpZDMuY29tL2Jsb2cvd291bGQteW91LWxpa2UtdG8tYmVjb21lLWEtYmV0dGVyLXByb2dyYW1tZXI=) from when I was trying to see if anyone was interested in my idea for GoRails.

Basically, I had been writing blog posts about random things, some of them being about Rails. At some point, I thought I should buy a domain specifically for my Rails content, so I bought GoRails.com and moved everything to it. This had some links from StackOverflow that drove traffic fairly quickly to it.

I used that audience (which was tiny) to see if there was interest. The responses to that form were really interesting, and started conversations with several people. It gave me enough confidence to launch a course for GoRails. I was scared to commit to weekly screencasts, so I tried a course instead.

That didn't go over well because nobody knew who I was, so why would they buy my course? I realized I'd need to share free content. It was great practice on its own, since screencasting is very hard; but it also showed people that they could learn things from my videos, and that they might just be worth paying for.

So it was a combination of SEO and sharing free content in the beginning that drove my first 10 customers. When I started charging for the weekly screencasts, some people freaked out, but others were supportive.

The first customers for Hatchbox and Jumpstart were easy; they were GoRails members, since the products are for the same audience. Feels like cheating, but the best way to launch a product is to an existing audience. You can skip the slow first months and have a lot of users immediately.

### How do you decide what to prioritize?

That's definitely been tough! Each project needs time every week, some more than others.

I try to prioritize support first. Customer service is important, so I make that a priority.

Then, I'll work on GoRails since it needs new content every single week. Luckily, I can use ideas from other projects to give me new content ideas.

The nice part about products like Hatchbox and Jumpstart Pro is that, once you've completed most of the features, you can run and maintain them. There's usually not super important features to add, so I can leave it lower down the priority list once support and GoRails is done.

It's definitely a balancing act, and you have to make sure the products mesh well together. Otherwise, you'll lose your mind trying to run multiple products at once!

### How did you hone your screencasting skills?

Screencasting is probably one of the hardest things I've done. I think it's just been the years of practice, doing videos every single week for like seven years. I don't want to really spend much time editing, so I practice recording as if we were pair programming and we're just chatting about a problem and how to solve it.

It is just me and one person part-time right now. I have tried to optimize each product to require as minimal maintenance as I can. The weekly screencasts are still a big commitment. For screencasts that require a lot of research and practice, I have to spend around 40 hours to make one video. Conversely, if I'm building a feature for Hatchbox that is fresh in my mind, I can make a screencast on it in about two hours.

Same goes for Hatchbox and Jumpstart Pro. Once they're kind of"feature complete," the majority of work is doing support or simple maintenance. It is just the initial development, and year or two of fixing bugs and solidifying the product, that takes the big effort. I try to do only one big new project at a time because of that.
