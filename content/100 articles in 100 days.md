### Indie hacking origins

When I got the job at Google, it was almost as if my mom did too. As an immigrant who started very, very poor, it meant her daughter had made it in life. So, it was really hard for her when I left.

I was doing really well. I had a great team, and I worked decent hours. I had nothing to complain about. But I got to a point where I could see the path in front of me very clearly, step-by-step. And that made me feel super depressed.

The year I left Google to start my own thing was so stressful. I felt like I needed to succeed so that my mom would see that it was fine. But...my startup failed.

I could have gone back to work for some other company, but I wouldn't have been happy. The more confident I became with my decision, the more chill my mom was. And since I’m still not homeless, I think she’s definitely come around.

### Crossing $100K ARR

Ness Labs started as a tiny newsletter in summer 2019. The community launched at the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020. I wanted to offer a space where people could connect, learn together, and hopefully make friends who like to geek out about the same topics.

### 100 articles in 100 days

In 2019, I decided to write 100 articles in 100 days (minus the weekends, because I care about my mental health). I wanted to challenge myself to write more and practice writing in English.

I’ve been a big believer in “learning in public” for a while now, but I noticed most people actually learn quite a bit on their own before publicly sharing their process. I wanted to actually start at zero and really be vulnerable about my journey.

I shared my goal on social media, and people started following my journey because they thought it was crazy. If I’d committed to an article a week, no one would have cared. But one a day for a hundred days was worth following.

Once I announced it, there was no going back.

I blocked out two hours every morning to write. At the end of that two hours, even if I knew it wasn’t perfect, I had to hit publish. The average length of my articles was around 880 words.

At the time, I was also doing freelance consulting so I had clients waiting on me. The tight deadline that I made for myself acted as a forcing mechanism. Sometimes those kinds of constraints can breed creativity, and that’s what happened for me.

I had no idea what I was doing, but I realized through this practice that consistency beats strategy. I kept going. Learning in public in this way changed who I was as a person. Now, I’m comfortable making mistakes, and trying to improve, in public.

Ness Labs absolutely would not be what it is today without those articles. They laid the foundation by generating hundreds of thousands of views, a dozen consulting contracts, and many coaching sessions. I have also been invited to several podcasts, and some articles were featured in the press.

### Dealing with time anxiety

I’m going to start a Ph.D program next month. There was a time in my life where I would have definitely thought it was already too late for that. But now, I know that there’s literally nothing preventing me from pursuing this thing I’m curious and passionate about. If it’s going to drive me forward and feed my curiosity, there is no reason I shouldn’t go for it.

It’s actually really sad when I look back at things I didn't do when I was younger because I thought I was “too late." In my early twenties, I wanted to start a YouTube channel, but I thought I was too late. This year, at 31, I’ve started a channel. It’s a lot of fun!

I manage my time anxiety a couple of ways. First, I just let myself feel it. Secondly, I stopped focusing on output (like getting a certain number of subscribers) and started focusing on input (like writing my first blog post or learning the first few words of a language).

It may seem paradoxical, but by trying to over-optimize our lives and only spending time on things that are sure to give us a certain amount of value, we actually end up reducing the value and meaning in our lives.

### Wrap up

-   What I’m reading: I just finished reading _Galileo's Error_ by Philip Goff, which has a great philosophical take on the science of consciousness. I’m now reading _Children of Time_ by Adrian Tchaikovsky. It’s a weird, fun science-fiction novel.
-   What I’m watching: I’m rewatching _The Midnight Gospel,_ and mentally preparing myself to ball my eyes out during the last episode.
-   What I’m listening to: There’s a wonderful corner of Spotify where you can listen to Alan Watts’ speeches over soothing background music. I absolutely love those.
-   Advice for beginner indie hackers: Don't fall prey to the end-of-history illusion. You still have many lives to live, and you don’t owe anything to your past self.
-   Quote I’m pondering: This quote by Aldous Huxley has guided many of my decisions this year:

Consistency is contrary to nature, contrary to life. The only completely consistent people are dead.
