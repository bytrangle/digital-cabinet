# Can We Get Rid of This
When I get hired to redesign something, there's one thing I always start with.

I point at EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT of the old design and ask "Can we get rid of this?" ![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/13.1.1/1f648/32.png)

It’s much cleaner, less intimidating – and, I’d be willing to bet, would meet the goal of _reducing support queries because people_ **_can’t_** _build their own cable with the online tool._

So... Not too shabby, huh?

But there’s **a simple secret** to this sort of redesign.

When faced with redesigning a busy page like this, we want to use the **6 strategies of simplicity.** It’s a framework I teach in [Learn UI Design](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/qduz7g50zkh7hkdw73fl/owh30n6ouqh4wokezmcv/aHR0cHM6Ly9sZWFybnVpLmRlc2lnbi8=) for making complex designs much neater, cleaner, and easier on the eyes.

I use this framework in basically every client project – so much so that it’s basically become second-nature.

One of the 6 tools is **REMOVING** – like I hinted at above. Here’s where I’d consider _removing_ stuff from this design:

![](https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/h-Q5mLKAWp9xEfQFvfFJjGYHWltBvnaGUNY1_4Kr1IYU1ljAG3tgJi0r9nH4geZpc01KAqeuKKmPnheJX3Y2ctbzZyqu6jfTGtZQSsnKvE89FALqrqMfQR7nvyFRjwRz2gDj7xQ=s0-d-e1-ft#https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/gJxGcuzsv4KXrV4Q8BDmRk/iA57DNvi6DgDZfwYqUmr3y/email)

But for stuff that’s _too important_ to be removed, we have another strategy to use... **HIDING**. You can _hide_ content:

-   In a popover
-   On a menu
-   On another tab
-   On another page
-   Etc.

Here’s the (already cleaner page) with a few candidates for hiding:

![](https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/ybe1oM3soYJQkIhxtFK9AX59ECp7ctMiA_UfvB7aob0Wpl3vK4CS_G1K31GjClYA_ml0XDvZFvnOQaa5x6cja49-623OPQt86D5dsshJB5C0OZmtz8l0nU0onbbzeSWwYye1Wek=s0-d-e1-ft#https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/gJxGcuzsv4KXrV4Q8BDmRk/b8ME4mgSJmLzKD6HHsh3oa/email)

But even once we hide this stuff, we still have a bit of a mess on our hands.

At this point, it’s not about **_getting rid_** _of elements_, but instead about **_rearranging_** _the elements we already have_.

The most applicable strategy at _that_ point – in my opinion – is **CONSISTENCY**. We style things _more similarly_ so that they feel more neater and cleaner.

For instance, “Cable” has a full-width card, while “Plug A” and “Plug B” are half-width. But what if they were all treated equally?

![](https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/ZrdjabKHnuAfjKzN32GMGO2sAexlYbueJ_pwXW0rhdOrR6s8kMl7YdIu9N31Mb2wBqfQyN-GexcfLXhxJW3uL1GNISFwswWJNgZLUL9ui6uYLJqgYKM00k6eymrYUSA3A_hxp8Y=s0-d-e1-ft#https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/gJxGcuzsv4KXrV4Q8BDmRk/3FtoFT3NLR35FWn37AQWvQ/email)

Cable, Plug A, and Plug B are all third-width

And at that point, we’re already well on our way to the final design:

Of course, the final design has a bunch more to it:

-   A better **font** (and a rationale for picking it)
-   Touched up **colors** (and a process for improving them)
-   A few more **elements** (and the logic behind their design)
