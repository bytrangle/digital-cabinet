## Overview [#](#overview)

Video games often present users with a creative and unusual menu, animated and in 3D space. It's popular in new AR/VR games to make the menu appear to be floating in space. Today we'll be recreating the essentials of this effect but with the added flair of an adaptive color scheme and accommodations for users who prefer reduced motion.

This guide uses experimental CSS [@custom-media](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-5/#custom-mq) and [@nest](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-nesting-1/) to prevent repeating media queries and to colocate media queries within component style blocks. The syntax proposed in those specs is enabled with PostCSS and these two plugins: [postcss-custom-media](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-custom-media) and [postcss-nesting](https://github.com/csstools/postcss-nesting).

## HTML [#](#html)

A game menu is a list of buttons. The best way to represent this in HTML is as follows:

    <ul class="threeD-button-set">  
      <li><button>New Game</button></li>  
      <li><button>Continue</button></li>  
      <li><button>Online</button></li>  
      <li><button>Settings</button></li>  
      <li><button>Quit</button></li>  
    </ul>

A list of buttons will announce itself well to screen reader technologies and works without JavaScript or CSS.

## CSS [#](#css)

Styling the button list breaks down into the following high level steps:

1.  Setting up custom properties.
2.  A flexbox layout.
3.  A custom button with decorative pseudo-elements.
4.  Placing elements into 3D space.

### Overview of custom properties [#](#overview-of-custom-properties)

Custom properties help disambiguate values by giving meaningful names to otherwise random-looking values, avoiding repeated code and sharing values amongst children.

Below are media queries saved as CSS variables, also known as [custom media](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-5/#custom-mq). These are global and will be used throughout various selectors to keep code concise and legible. The game menu component uses [motion preferences](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion), system [color scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme), and [color range capabilities](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-5/#dynamic-range) of the display.

    @custom-media --motionOK (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference);  
    @custom-media --dark (prefers-color-scheme: dark);  
    @custom-media --HDcolor (dynamic-range: high);

The following custom properties manage the color scheme and hold mouse positional values for making the game menu interactive to hover. Naming custom properties helps code legibility as it reveals the use case for the value or a friendly name for the result of the value.

The following variable naming convention uses strategies described in [this post](https://lea.verou.me/2021/10/custom-properties-with-defaults/) by [Lea Verou](https://twitter.com/LeaVerou).

```
.threeD-button-set {  
  --y:;  
  --x:;  
  --distance: 1px;  
  --theme: hsl(180 100% 50%);  
  --theme-bg: hsl(180 100% 50% / 25%);  
  --theme-bg-hover: hsl(180 100% 50% / 40%);  
  --theme-text: white;  
  --theme-shadow: hsl(180 100% 10% / 25%);

  --_max-rotateY: 10deg;  
  --_max-rotateX: 15deg;  
  --_btn-bg: var(--theme-bg);  
  --_btn-bg-hover: var(--theme-bg-hover);  
  --_btn-text: var(--theme-text);  
  --_btn-text-shadow: var(--theme-shadow);  
  --_bounce-ease: cubic-bezier(.5, 1.75, .75, 1.25);

  @media (--dark) {  
    --theme: hsl(255 53% 50%);  
    --theme-bg: hsl(255 53% 71% / 25%);  
    --theme-bg-hover: hsl(255 53% 50% / 40%);  
    --theme-shadow: hsl(255 53% 10% / 25%);  
  }

  @media (--HDcolor) {  
    @supports (color: color(display-p3 0 0 0)) {  
      --theme: color(display-p3 .4 0 .9);  
    }  
  }  
}


```

### Light and dark theme background conic backgrounds [#](#light-and-dark-theme-background-conic-backgrounds)

The light theme has a vibrant `cyan` to `deeppink` [conic gradient](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/conic-gradient()) while the dark theme has a dark subtle conic gradient. To see more about what can be done with conic gradients, see [conic.style](https://www.conic.style/).

```
html {  
  background: conic-gradient(at -10% 50%, deeppink, cyan);

  @media (--dark) {  
    background: conic-gradient(at -10% 50%, #212529, 50%, #495057, #212529);      
  }  
}


```

### Enabling 3D perspective [#](#enabling-3d-perspective)

For elements to exist in the 3D space of a web page, a viewport with [perspective](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/perspective) needs to be initialized. I chose to put the perspective on the `body` element and used viewport units to create the style I liked.

    body {  
      perspective: 40vw;  
    }

This is the type of impact perspective can have.

### Styling the `<ul>` button list [#](#styling-the-lessulgreater-button-list)

This element is responsible for the overall button list macro layout as well as being an interactive and 3D floating card. Here's a way to achieve that.

#### Button group layout [#](#button-group-layout)

Flexbox can manage the container layout. Change the default direction of flex from rows to columns with `flex-direction` and ensure each item is the size of its contents by changing from `stretch` to `start` for `align-items`.

```
.threeD-button-set {  
    
  margin: 0;

    
  display: flex;  
  flex-direction: column;  
  align-items: flex-start;  
  gap: 2.5vh;  
}


```

Next, establish the container as a 3D space context and set up CSS `clamp()` functions to ensure the card doesn't rotate beyond legible rotations. Notice that the middle value for the clamp is a custom property, these `--x` and `--y` values will be [set from JavaScript](#mouse-parallax-interaction) upon mouse interaction later.

```
.threeD-button-set {  
  â€¦

      
  transform-style: preserve-3d;

    
  transform:   
    rotateY(  
      clamp(  
        calc(var(--_max-rotateY) * -1),   
        var(--y),   
        var(--_max-rotateY)  
      )  
    )   
    rotateX(  
      clamp(  
        calc(var(--_max-rotateX) * -1),   
        var(--x),   
        var(--_max-rotateX)  
      )  
    )  
  ;  
}


```

Next, if motion is OK with the visiting user, add a hint to the browser that this item's transform will be constantly changing with [`will-change`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/will-change). Additionally, enable interpolation by setting a `transition` on transforms. This transition will occur when the mouse interacts with the card, enabling smooth transitions to rotation changes. The animation is a constant running animation that demonstrates the 3D space the card is within, even if a mouse can't or isn't interacting with the component.

```
@media (--motionOK) {  
  .threeD-button-set {  
      
    will-change: transform;

      
    transition: transform .1s ease;  
    animation: rotate-y 5s ease-in-out infinite;  
  }  
}


```

The `rotate-y` animation only sets the middle keyframe at `50%` since the browser will default `0%` and `100%` to the default style of the element. This is shorthand for animations that alternate, needing to begin and end at the same position. It's a great way to articulate infinite alternating animations.

    @keyframes rotate-y {  
      50% {  
        transform: rotateY(15deg) rotateX(-6deg);  
      }  
    }

### Styling the `<li>` elements [#](#styling-the-lessligreater-elements)

Each list item (`<li>`) contains the button and its border elements. The `display` style is changed so the item doesn't show a [`::marker`](https://web.dev/css-marker-pseudo-element/). The `position` style is set to `relative` so the upcoming button pseudo-elements can position themselves within the full area the button consumes.

```
.threeD-button-set > li {  
    
  display: inline-flex;

    
  position: relative;

    
  transform-style: preserve-3d;   
}


```

### Styling the `<button>` elements [#](#styling-the-lessbuttongreater-elements)

Styling buttons can be tough work, there's a lot of states and interaction types to account for. These buttons get complex quickly due to balancing pseudo-elements, animations and interactions.

#### Initial `<button>` styles [#](#initial-lessbuttongreater-styles)

Below are the foundational styles that will support the other states.

```
.threeD-button-set button {  
    
  appearance: none;  
  outline: none;  
  border: none;

      
  background-color: var(--_btn-bg);  
  color: var(--_btn-text);  
  text-shadow: 0 1px 1px var(--_btn-text-shadow);

    
  font-size: 5vmin;  
  font-family: Audiowide;  
  padding-block: .75ch;  
  padding-inline: 2ch;  
  border-radius: 5px 20px;  
}


```

![](https://web-dev.imgix.net/image/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/mfv2DarGZ9woqmV2avMH.png?auto=format)

#### Button pseudo-elements [#](#button-pseudo-elements)

The borders of the button aren't traditional borders, they're absolute position pseudo-elements with borders.

![](https://web-dev.imgix.net/image/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/iNeDRVIv7UK1hRxx8r2z.png?auto=format)

These elements are crucial in showcasing the 3D perspective that's been established. One of these pseudo-elements will be pushed away from the button, and one will be pulled closer to the user. The effect is most noticeable in the top and bottom buttons.

```
.threeD-button button {  
  â€¦

  &::after,  
  &::before

 {  
      
    content: '';  
    opacity: .8;

      
    position: absolute;  
    inset: 0;

      
    border: 1px solid var(--theme);  
    border-radius: 5px 20px;  
  }

      
    
  &::before {  
    border-width: 3px;

      
    @media (--dark) {  
      box-shadow:   
        0 0 25px var(--theme),   
        inset 0 0 25px var(--theme);  
    }  
  }  
}


```

#### 3D transform styles [#](#3d-transform-styles)

Below `transform-style` is set to `preserve-3d` so the children can space themselves out on the `z` axis. The `transform` is set to the `--distance` custom property, which will be increased on [hover and focus](#hover-and-focus-interaction-styles).

```
.threeD-button-set button {  
  â€¦

  transform: translateZ(var(--distance));  
  transform-style: preserve-3d;

  &::after {  
      
    transform: translateZ(calc(var(--distance) / 3));  
  }

    &::before {  
      
    transform: translateZ(calc(var(--distance) / 3 * -1));  
  }  
}


```

#### Conditional animation styles [#](#conditional-animation-styles)

If the user is OK with motion, the button hints to the browser that the transform property should be ready for change and a transition is set for `transform` and `background-color` properties. Notice the difference in duration, I felt it made for a nice subtle staggered effect.

```
.threeD-button-set button {  
  â€¦

    @media (--motionOK) {  
    will-change: transform;  
    transition:   
      transform .2s ease,  
      background-color .5s ease  
    ;

        &::before,  
    &::after

 {  
      transition: transform .1s ease-out;    
    }

    &::after    { transition-duration: .5s }  
    &::before { transition-duration: .3s }  
  }  
}


```

#### Hover and focus interaction styles [#](#hover-and-focus-interaction-styles)

The goal of the interaction animation is to spread the layers that made up the flat appearing button. Accomplish this by setting the `--distance` variable, initially to `1px`. The selector shown in the following code example checks to see if the button is being hovered or focused by a device that should see a focus indicator, and not being activated. If so it applies CSS to do the following:

-   Apply the hover background color.
-   Increase the distance .
-   Add a bounce ease effect.
-   Stagger the pseudo-element transitions.

The varying `transition-duration` values are only on hover, staggering the animation only for hover. When hover or focus are removed, each layer transitions in unison to the resting place.

```
.threeD-button-set button {  
  â€¦

  &:is(:hover, :focus-visible):not(:active)

 {  
      
    --distance: 15px;  
    background-color: var(--_btn-bg-hover);

      
    @media (--motionOK) {  
      --distance: 3vmax;

      transition-timing-function: var(--_bounce-ease);  
      transition-duration: .4s;

      &::after  { transition-duration: .5s }  
      &::before { transition-duration: .3s }  
    }  
  }  
}


```

The 3D perspective was still really neat for the `reduced` motion preference. The top and bottom elements show the effect in a nice subtle way.

### Small enhancements with JavaScript [#](#small-enhancements-with-javascript)

The interface is usable from keyboards, screen readers, gamepads, touch and a mouse already, but we can add some light touches of JavaScript to ease a couple of scenarios.

#### Supporting arrow keys [#](#supporting-arrow-keys)

The tab key is a fine way to navigate the menu but I'd expect the directional pad or joysticks to move focus on a gamepad. The [roving-ux](https://github.com/argyleink/roving-ux) library often used for GUI Challenge interfaces will handle arrow keys for us. The below code tells the library to trap focus within `.threeD-button-set` and forward the focus to the button children.

```
import {rovingIndex} from 'roving-ux'

rovingIndex({  
  element: document.querySelector('.threeD-button-set'),  
  target: 'button',  
})


```

### Mouse parallax interaction [#](#mouse-parallax-interaction)

Tracking the mouse and having it tilt the menu is intended to mimic AR and VR video game interfaces, where instead of a mouse you may have a virtual pointer. It can be fun when elements are hyper aware of the pointer.

Since this is a small extra feature, we'll put the interaction behind a query of the user's motion preference. Also, as part of setup, store the button list component into memory with `querySelector` and cache the element's bounds into `menuRect`. Use these bounds to determine the rotate offset applied to the card based on mouse position.

```
const menu = document.querySelector('.threeD-button-set')  
const menuRect = menu.getBoundingClientRect()

const { matches:motionOK } = window.matchMedia(  
  '(prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)'  
)


```

Next, we need a function that accepts the mouse `x` and `y` positions and return a value we can use to rotate the card. The following function uses the mouse position to detemine which side of the box it's inside of and by how much. The delta is returned from the function.

```
const getAngles = (clientX, clientY) => {  
  const { x, y, width, height } = menuRect 

    const dx = clientX - (x + 0.5 * width)  
  const dy = clientY - (y + 0.5 * height)

    return {dx,dy}  
}


```

Lastly, watch the mouse move, pass the position to our `getAngles()` function and use the delta values as custom property styles. I divided by 20 to pad the delta and make it less twitchy, there may be a better way to do that. If you remember from the beginning, we put the `--x` and `--y` props in the middle of a `clamp()` function, this prevents the mouse position from overly rotating the card into an illegible position.

```
if (motionOK) {  
  window.addEventListener('mousemove', ({target, clientX, clientY}) => {  
    const {dx,dy} = getAngles(clientX, clientY)

    menu.attributeStyleMap.set('--x', `${dy / 20}deg`)  
    menu.attributeStyleMap.set('--y', `${dx / 20}deg`)  
  })  
}


```

## Translations and directions [#](#translations-and-directions)

There was one gotcha when testing out the game menu in other writing modes and languages.

`<button>` elements have an `!important` style for `writing-mode` in the user agent stylesheet. This meant the game menu HTML needed to change to accommodate the desired design. Changing the button list to a list of links enables logical properties to change the menu direction, as `<a>` elements don't have a browser supplied `!important` style.

## Conclusion [#](#conclusion)

Now that you know how I did it, how would youâ€½ ðŸ™‚ Can you add accelerometer interaction to the menu, so tiling your phone rotates the menu? Can we improve the no motion experience?

Let's diversify our approaches and learn all the ways to build on the web. Create a demo, [tweet me](https://twitter.com/argyleink) links, and I'll add it to the community remixes section below!
