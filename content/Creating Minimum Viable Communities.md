In the product and startup world, the term ["minimum viable product"](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/4zugogd3w4teh79nx3bx/n2hohvhn6rvq6mh6/aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvTWluaW11bV92aWFibGVfcHJvZHVjdA==) is well-known. In fact, it's impossible to escape!

With community, it makes sense to implement the same concept: Build a minimum viable community (MVC). Don't build too much without knowing you are on the right track. Stop doing lots of planning upfront, and embrace small-scale experimentation instead. Here's how!

### Minimum viable community

An MVC is the smallest action that you can take to bring people together. An MVC is not necessarily a community, at least not yet. The intentions and vision are probably there, but the community may not be.

An MVC is not about having all the pieces in place for your dream community. It's about experimenting to find out what brings value. It's about building relationships and trust in a manageable way. This will help you find your path with the community you actually need to build.

An MVC is about creating the dots that you will need later to connect the community.

### Why build an MVC?

Everyone wants community these days. To be honest, while I fully support it in any way I can, it's a bit of a worrying trend. There are lots of people, products, and companies that are scrambling to lure people in with the promise of community.

MVCs are a perfect way to get started with community, not only to understand if building the community is right for you, but also to understand what people actually need from it.

Remember that part of the validation of building community is whether people want to join in with whoever leads it. Just because you want a community doesn't mean that others will want to follow you into it. MVCs are a great way to test out whether people will get behind what you want to build.

Starting small is perhaps the only authentic way of doing this. Authenticity matters if you want people to open up and share what they are really after. A community without trust is one that will likely not survive.

You can be mindful of the culture you are creating through your own behavior, and the behavior of those that you invite in. Focus on the outcomes and learnings rather than the metrics.

### MVC is a mindset

Just like you can pivot in a business, you can also pivot in a community. You may go in thinking that the community needs a certain thing, only to discover that it's not what will help them with their goals.

To build community, you need to listen to what your community is saying and doing. What are slippery slopes for people? What do people see as safe bets?

MVCs are great for building blocks on your [community flywheels](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/4zugogd3w4teh79nx3bx/08hwh9hmgz2eg6il/aHR0cHM6Ly9yb3NpZS5sYW5kL3Bvc3RzP3RvcGljPWZseXdoZWVscw==). Also, if you don't keep experimenting with new ideas, your community may end up becoming irrelevant. And irrelevant communities [just don't survive](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/4zugogd3w4teh79nx3bx/8ghqhohgq9odqmak/aHR0cHM6Ly9yb3NpZS5sYW5kL3Bvc3RzL3BlcmhhcHMtdGhlLWdvYWwtZm9yLWNvbW11bml0aWVzLWlzLXRvLWJlY29tZS1yZWxldmFudA==).

### MVC ideas

Here are some ideas to get you going:

-   _Newsletters:_ Newsletters are easy to start, and are also easy to adapt over time.
-   _Audio:_ Social audio is a great way to connect and converse with people. The magic is that you can start small. Really, you only need to be willing to have a conversation with one other person; everyone else is a bonus.
-   _Social forums:_ These are public places like Reddit and Facebook groups. You can consider either joining one that already exists, or starting your own. They are easy to start, but it is hard to control the outcome. Because you don't own the data, the eyeball competition is much harder. Plus, you are at the mercy of algorithms.
-   _Take notes together:_ Think Google Docs, Google Sheets, Miro, etc. Coming together to take notes is fun, productive, and creates a valuable outcome. It also helps to create connections between the contributors and generate new ideas.
-   _Small events, meetups, and 1:1s:_ This was how I got started in the world of community! Going into events with the expectation of them being small creates reasonable expectations for community builders.
-   _Memes:_ We can tap into our shared knowledge, spur on discussions, and inspire and educate one another. Memes are a great way to practice understanding who your people are, especially when you can get people to feel seen.
-   _Merch and swag:_ Things like stickers and t-shirts can bring real visibility and connection to people.
-   _Podcasting:_ Podcasts are great for amplifying voices and ideas of the people you want to connect with in a deeper way.

### When to use MVCs?

MVCs are more about the mindset of constantly experimenting. You should be doing this all the time, no matter the size of your community.

Creating an MVC shouldn't be the first step in building a community. I recommend starting with [Community Discovery](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/4zugogd3w4teh79nx3bx/m2h7h5home35mxtm/aHR0cHM6Ly9vcmJpdC5sb3ZlL2Jsb2cvdGhlLWNvbW11bml0eS1kaXNjb3ZlcnktZnJhbWV3b3Jr) or by [studying your people](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/4zugogd3w4teh79nx3bx/e0hph7hkq47v49h8/aHR0cHM6Ly9yb3NpZS5sYW5kL3Bvc3RzL2ZpcnN0LXN0dWR5LXlvdXItcGVvcGxl). This will help you get going on the right track.
