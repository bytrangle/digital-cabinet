# Kinetic Typography Page Transition - Codrops
A concept for a kinetic typography based page transition where background letters come into the foreground and reveal a new content level.

The other day I was drooling over [HOLOGRAPHIK’s](https://dribbble.com/holographik) amazing kinetic typography animations. Especially [this one](https://dribbble.com/shots/16174007-Kinetic-Typography) caught my eye. There’s a very interesting (very short) part where some words are being rotated and zoomed in, and I couldn’t help but think of a page transitions that somehow incorporates that idea.

So I went ahead and tried it on a simple layout to see how it could work. Turns out it’s a lot of fun and there’s so many possibilities for making this look and feel right for a specific design.

The initial screen has some items:

Once we click on an item, the typography page transition happens. The faded background letters starts to rotate and become more visible and finally, they move out, revealing the next screen:

Here’s the whole animation (the color is actually a bit off in the video):
