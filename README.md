# Digital Cabinet

A digital cabinet of articles I've read. 80% of the content focus on web development, ranging from performance optimization, architecture, web animation etc, The remaining 20% are on business, marketing, thought pieces etc.

Articles are saved with the clip-to-anything [Web Clipper](https://github.com/webclipper/web-clipper)
